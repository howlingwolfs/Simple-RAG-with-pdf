Macro landscape remains
supportive of commercial
real estate growth

Macroeconomic Overview

The UAE GDP growth forecast for 2025 has been revised down marginally to 4.9%, partly
due to softer growth in 2024 after revisions were made by the Federal Competitive and
Statistics Centre (FCSC), resulting in a lower base for Q1 2025.

Oil production reached 3.07 mn b/d in September, with an October target of 3.39 mn b/d,
supported by OPEC+’s stronger demand outlook and capacity expansion plans, including a
potential 6 mn b/d target beyond 2027. Brent averaged $68/bbl in September, slightly up
from August but below early-year highs.

The full unwinding of 2.2 mn b/d cuts in September is set to accelerate output, supporting
GDP forecasts, with further momentum in 2026 as new facilities come online.

The non-oil economy remains resilient, supported by fiscal strength, tourism, and
diversification, with growth projected at 4.6% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026.

The UAE is advancing diversification through CEPAs with India, Angola, and New Zealand,
aiming to push non-oil trade beyond USD 10 billion by 2030. Abu Dhabi’s 35% rise in non-oil
trade in H1 2025 reflects this momentum.

Dubai recorded 11.17 million overnight visitors in Jan—Jul 2025 (+5% y-o-y), while Abu Dhabi
welcomed 3.44 million visitors in the same period (+2% y-o-y), putting the UAE on track for
27.6 million international arrivals this year.

Macroeconomic Overview

Inflation forecasts have been cut to 1.9% from 2.5%, and down from 2.1% in 2024, driven by lower energy costs,
moderating transport expenses, and easing food and commodity prices.

In September 2025, the UAE’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 54.2 from 53.3 in August, signaling a
rebound and sustained economic resilience despite external pressures. Dubai’s PMI also climbed to 54.2 from
53.6, reinforcing strong expansionary momentum.

Confidence in the UAE’s business environment remains strong. The World Security Report, commissioned by
Allied Universal and G4S, ranked the UAE as the world’s safest and most economically resilient business hub.
Only 29% of UAE security leaders view economic instability as a risk, compared to global and regional averages
of 44% and 41%.

According to data from the Financial Times fDi Intelligence, the UAE continues to lead global Greenfield FDI
performance. The UAE secured close to AED 22 billion across more than 700 projects in the first half of 2025,
with Dubai accounting for over 600 projects with capital inflows of over AED 12 billion. Sharjah emerged as the
second largest recipient with 25 projects valued at around AED 5 billion, Abu Dhabi securing close to 60 projects
worth over AED3 billion.

The UAE is also advancing its technology and investment agenda through the ‘We the UAE 2037 vision, visa
reforms, and partnerships with the World Economic Forum to accelerate tech adoption and attract foreign
investment. Complementing these efforts, Dubai’s D33 Agenda targets economic growth, FDI, and trade, while
Abu Dhabi’s industrial strategy aims to double manufacturing by 2030.

Non-oil growth and strategic reforms continue to drive the UAE
towards a diversified and balanced economy, as the nation
accelerates its transition from an oil economy to a future-ready

nation powered by innovation, strategic AI investments, and
advanced technology.

GITEX 2025: Real Estate Highlights

(October 13-17, 2025)

Dubai

Dubai Land Department (DLD) made a strong push toward digitizing the property market at GITEX
2025, unveiling a suite of initiatives aimed at streamlining real estate transactions and enhancing
investor confidence. A major highlight was the launch of fully digital property sales via the
DubaiNow app, enabling buyers and sellers to complete transactions remotely using UAE Pass.
The department also introduced a Real Estate Transactions Platform, offering real-time dashboards
of market activity to improve transparency and data accessibility.

In collaboration with Google Cloud, DLD launched an Al-powered Investor Assistant, designed to
provide predictive insights and data-driven recommendations for smarter investment
decisions. This aligns with Dubai’s broader vision of positioning Al as a core enabler of real estate
growth. Another key innovation was the Rental Index Heatmap, an Al-driven tool that provides
real-time rental value indicators for individual units across the city. This empowers landlords and
tenants with accurate, location-specific data to guide pricing and leasing decisions.

To further enhance customer experience, DLD partnered with Microsoft to implement a unified CRM
system built on Dynamics 365, integrating all service channels and leveraging Al for efficient service
delivery. Additionally, a strategic partnership with Emirates NBD aims to digitize the leasing
ecosystem, including security deposit management and financing solutions, contributing to a more
seamless and tenant-friendly rental process.

Together, these initiatives underscore the concerted
nationwide efforts being made towards delivering smart
governance and tech-enabled real estate services,

which will ultimately help to position the UAE as a
global benchmark for property market digital
transformation. By bringing all services online,

reducing friction, accelerating transaction times, and
embedding trust through advanced technologies, the
UAE is not only meeting current market demands, but it
is also effectively shaping a future-ready real estate
ecosystem that will attract even more international
investors. The changes are also expected to further

Abu Dhabi

Abu Dhabi’s Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT), in collaboration with the Abu
Dhabi Real Estate Centre (ADREC), announced the launch of the region’s first government-
backed digital property transaction platform. Integrated into the TAMM portal, this initiative
enables end-to-end online property transactions, including digital mortgage registration, trustee
verification, and escrow settlement. It marks a significant leap toward a paperless, remote-friendly
real estate ecosystem.

A major technological advancement came with the unveiling of LivAl, a digital twin platform
that serves as the central intelligence layer for urban planning and infrastructure management.
LivAl leverages real-time data, predictive analytics, and robotics to simulate and optimize city
development. Complementing this, DMT introduced a Smart Inspection Robot deployed in Family
Park, capable of autonomous patrols and maintenance checks, showcasing the practical application
of Al in public space management.

To accelerate its smart city vision, DMT signed 10 strategic MoUs with global tech leaders including
e&, Capgemini, Hikvision, and Origen Technology. These partnerships focus on deploying Al drones
for infrastructure inspection, developing smart surveillance systems, and building a Unified Smart
City Platform for intelligent governance. Collectively, these initiatives reinforce Abu Dhabi’s
commitment to integrating real estate, mobility, and public services into a cohesive, data-driven
urban ecosystem.

boost transaction volumes, improve liquidity, and
enhance transparency, whilst also boosting investor
confidence and driving market maturity, all whilst
giving the UAE another competitive edge.

Dubai Offices

Commercial office demand remained firm through Q3
2025, despite a summer period that was impacted by the
heightened regional geo-political tensions.

However, with available office supply at a cyclical low
right across the Dubai market, occupiers continue to face
major challenges in finding suitable alternative
accommodation, particularly across prominent freezone
destination such as DIFC, d3, TECOM, and DMCC.

Across the market, supply levels remain incredibly tight,
encouraging corporate occupiers to consider early pre-
leasing discussions with landlords on upcoming projects
such as DIFC Square (Q1 2026), and Dubai CommerCity,
Buildings A1 & A3 (Q4 2025), and Innovation Hub Phase
lll. In all these cases, this has resulted in secured pre-
commitments from existing tenants within the respective
freezones, with multiple other deals being negotiated on
remaining spaces.

With demand outpacing supply, construction activity has
been accelerated across several prominent commercial
developments, with quick progress being made at DIFC’s
Immersive Tower (adjacent to the Waldorf Astoria), which
is already well above ground and on track for completion
in 2027, ahead of other competition, including Aldar’s
DIFC office.

Office rentals have continued to grow year-on-year,
averaging around 19% in the 12 months to Q3, and nearly
3% quarter-on-quarter. With escalating occupational
costs, the trend for renewals continues, something which
is with likely to prevail for the foreseeable future amidst
limitations of other market options for immediate lease.

CBRE RESEARCH

Major deals during the quarter included a strong focus on
Flex spaces with 75,000 sq ft leased across two deals
alone, and with strong latent demand for other operators
to expand and enter the local market.

Office completions were again very limited in Q3 (21,000
sqm GLA), with a slightly larger volume expected in Q4
(63,000 sqm GLA), although not adequate to really
impact the supply and demand dynamics.

Activity in the strata sector also remains buoyant, with
further new launches, including Omniyat’s Lumena Alta
project in September. Located in Business Bay, the 73
floor, 720,000-sq-ft office scheme is currently penned for
completion in 2030.

As of the end of September 2025, average occupancy
rates across assets remained steady at around 94%, up
from 93% for the same quarter last year and from 92% a
year prior. We expect this uptrend to continue over the
next 12-18 months at least before the market starts to see
any relief with the addition of new supply.

Abu Dhabi Offices

Demand in Abu Dhabi’s office sector remains robust,
driven by the continued influx of foreign companies.
During H1 2025, ADGM issued 1,869 new licenses, the
highest six-month total since its inception, bringing the
overall count to 11,128 active licenses. Operational
entities rose to 2,972, up 42% year-on-year, including 308
financial firms. The asset management (AM) segment
also maintained strong momentum, with AUM increasing
42% y-o-y, supported by 154 active managers overseeing
209 funds. This expansion has pushed the combined
workforce across Al Maryah and Al Reem Islands to
nearly 36,000 professionals.

ADGM now hosts a growing roster of leading institutions,
including JP Morgan, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley,
Rothschild & Co, Ninety One, GQG Partners, The World
Bank, The Children’s Investment Fund (TCD, Partners
Group, Circle, Carta, Bitcoin Suisse, eToro, and BNY
Mellon’s Alpheya among others, alongside major UAE
entities such as Mubadala, Alpha Dhabi, Lunate, ADQ,
and IHC.

Increase in average leasing

rates (year-on-year)

CBRE RESEARCH

H1 2025 was marked by several landmark deals, such as
Fortress’s partnership with Mubadala worth of US 1 bn,
Kimmeridge’s energy MoU with Mubadala Energy, the
launch of a US +1 bn Al-native reinsurance platform by
IHC, BlackRock, and Lunate, and the expansion of

Mubadala & Alpha Dhabi’s private credit JV to US 2.5 bn.

As a result, office space on Al Maryah Island is now
virtually fully occupied, with larger available units limited
to Reem Island towers, which lack the Grade-A appeal of
ADGM Square and Maryah Tower.

Market-wide, average occupancy rose to 97%, up from
96% in Q2. Amid this tight supply, average office rents
climbed 8% y-o-y to AED 1,865 per sqm per annum, with
prime rents up nearly 10%. Quoting rents for remaining
quality space are now significantly higher, reflecting the
premium on availability.

Despite strong demand, new development remains
limited, and the current supply shortfall is unlikely to
ease before 2027, extending landlord-favorable
conditions for the foreseeable future.

Dubai Residential

Residential sector activity gained further momentum in Q3
2025, defying earlier expectations of a summer slowdown
amid rising geopolitical tensions. Dubai’s housing market
continues to showcase strong resilience, underpinned by
sustained investor appetite and a deepening development
pipeline that signals confidence in long-term growth.

Since 2020, the city has added an average of 30,000 new
units annually, but this is set to accelerate rapidly in the
coming years, with a pipeline of approximately 320,000
units expected by the end of 2029 - averaging 64,000
units per year. Whilst the pipeline is a reflection of investor
confidence in Dubai’s long-term appeal, it does raise some
questions about the absorption capacity of the rental
market, and infrastructure readiness of some locations to
handle such a sizable ramp-up in deliveries and
subsequently population.

Rental rates remain elevated from a cyclical perspective,
although the pace of growth has now slowed and moved
into negative territory quarter on quarter, dropping by
0.2%. However, year-on-year, average rents for all property
types are still up 5.6%, with apartments increasing 6.2%
and villas by 2.9%.

In contrast, sales prices continue to climb, with a 12.9%
annual increase, with apartments +12.7% and villas +14.9%.
Quarter-on-quarter, sales prices rose by 3%, reflecting
ongoing buyer interest and investment momentum.

That said, market performance remains fragmented, with
certain locations outperforming others. For apartments,
Dubai Silicon Oasis (DSO) led with a 36% annual price
increase, followed by DIFC at 34%. This has been

supported by announcements of major infrastructure
projects, including the Metro Blue Line which passes
through DSO, and major road and tunnelling works around
DIFC which aim to alleviate traffic congestion around the
financial center. Town Square has also seen solid growth,
rising 24% y-o-y despite resident’s complains over traffic
exiting the community during peak times. More mature
areas such as Business Bay, JLT, and Downtown saw more
modest gains of 3%, 4%, and 7%, respectively. Villa
communities showed similar divergence with Victory
Heights posting a 36% y-o-y increase, Al Barari 28%, and
Jumeirah Park 21%, whilst Emirates Hills and JGE saw
more restrained growth of 6%.

While the overall trajectory remains positive, there are
some issues that warrant attention. Dubai’s population
continues to grow rapidly, placing pressure on housing
affordability and infrastructure. As prices rise, so too do
living costs, impacting the city’s competitiveness for
middle-income residents. However, the government
continue to respond with targeted initiatives such as the
Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan, which promotes balanced
land use and affordable housing, while ongoing expansion
of public transport networks continues to enhance
connectivity to more affordable areas. Reforms in tenancy
law and digitization of property transactions further
support transparency and investor confidence, collectively
reflecting the proactive approach to managing growth and
maintaining long-term market stability.

Dubai Residential

Dubai’s residential real estate market continues to
demonstrate forward momentum, with strong quarterly
volumes and sustained year-on-year growth in
transactions volumes and average values.

In the first nine months of 2025 (9M2025), the market
registered 151,522 residential transactions, up 20%
compared to the same period last year. The total value of
these transactions reached AED 408.7 bn, reflecting a 29%
increase. Q3 alone saw 56,723 transactions worth AED
139.8 bn, both up 16% y-o-y, marking the second
consecutive quarter of record-breaking transaction
volumes.

Off-plan sales remain the primary driver of market activity,
accounting for 75% of total transactions. During 9M2025,
off-plan volumes reached 108,692 units (+27% y-o-y), with
values climbing to AED 295.9 billion (+35% y-o-y). Q3 off-
plan activity was particularly strong, with volumes rising
25% to 42,777 units and values increasing 19% to AED
103.9 bn, underscoring investor confidence in future
supply and long-term prospects.

Ready transactions, which represent 25% of the market,
showed more moderate performance. In 9M2025, volumes
rose by 5% to 42,830 units, with values up 15% to AED
112.8 bn. However, Q3 figures reflected a slight dip in
volumes (-3% y-o-y), though average values still rose by
7% to AED 35.9 bn, indicating continued demand for
completed inventory.

By typology, off-plan apartments and villas led the market
in y-o-y growth, rising by 36.8% and 35.7%, respectively.
Notably, villa plots saw the highest surge, with a 57.8%

increase in transaction volumes.

This performance is underpinned by Dubai’s expanding
population, which has surpassed 4 million residents. The
city is also projected to welcome 9,800 new millionaires in
2025, further fueling demand for premium residential
assets. Notably, transactions exceeding AED 10 mn have
continued to rise, reinforcing Dubai’s position as a global
hub for luxury real estate.

However, the rapid pace of growth has raised concerns
around affordability and accessibility, particularly for
middle-income residents. To address these challenges,
innovative solutions are gaining traction, including
fractional ownership through real estate tokenization and
government-backed programs such as the First-Time
Home Buyer initiative. These efforts aim to broaden
access to property ownership and reinforce long-term
market inclusivity.

Abu Dhabi Residential

Abu Dhabi’s residential market recorded strong growth in
the first nine months of 2025, with 14,350 transactions
(+43% y-o-y) totaling AED 46.1 billion (+67% y-o-y). Q3
alone saw 6,610 deals (+79% y-o-y) worth AED 21.2 billion
(+106% y-o-y), marking the strongest quarterly
performance on record. Off-plan sales led the momentum
with a 56% y-o-y increase, while ready transactions rose
24% y-o-y, driven primarily by robust activity on Al Reem
and Yas Islands across both segments.

Similarly, the market delivered a standout price
performance in Q3 2025, with average sales prices
surging over 25% y-o-y, driven by strong investor
sentiment, limited new supply, and a growing appetite for
lifestyle-led communities.

Apartments continued to outperform villas, with Yas
Island emerging as a top performer - recording a
remarkable 30% annual price increase in apartments and
13% in villas. This spike was supported by the recent
announcement of Disneyland Abu Dhabi, the region’s first
Disney theme park, which is set to open on Yas Island.

Other communities also posted strong gains, with Shams
Abu Dhabi up 31% y-o-y, fueled by high-end and branded
launches like Seamont Residences by Marriott, and Reef
Villas rising 25% y-o-y. These results highlight growing
demand for both premium developments and family-
oriented mid-market housing.

Rental rates rose sharply, up 25% y-o-y, with apartments
leading at 29% growth. This surge reflects strong
population inflows and a tightening rental supply,

reinforcing demand across key urban communities.

Abu Dhabi’s residential market is set to deliver around
8,500 units in 2025, with a strong pipeline of
approximately 36,000 units through 2029, averaging
more than 9,000 units a year.

Q3 saw fewer launches, but demand remained
exceptional, with several new project launches selling out
within hours or days. Wadeem by Modon moved over
1,700 residential plots in 72 hours, Yas Living by Aldar
sold over 670 apartments with 65% international buyers,
and Al Deem townhouses sold 450 units exclusively to
locals. Collectively, these launches generated AED 8.6
billion in record time, underscoring surging demand from
both local and global buyers, particularly younger and
first-time homeowners seeking lifestyle-driven
communities.

UAE Hospitality

The UAE’s tourism sector continues to demonstrate
robust growth in 2025, reinforcing its strategic role in the
country’s economic diversification agenda.

Dubai welcomed 11.17 million international visitors
between January and July 2025, up from 10.62 million in
the same period last year, with Western Europe (21%), the
GCC (16%), and South Asia and CIS/Eastern Europe (each
15%) emerging as key source markets. Abu Dhabi
recorded 3.44 million international visitors in the same
period, a 2% year-on-year increase, led by arrivals from
Asia (31%) and Europe (25%). RAK also saw a steady
influx, with 653,700 international visitors in H1 2025
driven primarily by tourists from the Russian Federation
(31%) and the UK (8%).

Hotel performance across the emirates reflects this
upward trajectory. Dubai’s hospitality sector operated 821
establishments with 152,364 rooms, achieving a 79%
occupancy rate - up from 77% in 2024. Average daily rate
(ADR) rose 5% to AED 551, while revenue per available
room (RevPAR) increased 7% to AED 435 during the first
seven months of 2025.

Abu Dhabi mirrored this trend during the same period
from Jan-Jul 2025, with 172 establishments, 34,397 rooms
and 9.41 million guest nights, also reaching 79%
occupancy (+4% y-o-y). Notably, ADR surged 19% to AED
530 and RevPAR climbed 24% to AED 426. Abu Dhabi has
also generated AED 4.8 bn in total hotel revenues
between January and July 2025, marking a robust 19%
year-on-year increase driven by significant gains in ADR.

CBRE RESEARCH

RAK’s 55 hotel establishments reported a 72% occupancy
rate during the first half of 2025, a slight increase from 71%
last year, with ADR at AED 637.2 (+7.6% y-o-y) and RevPAR
at AED 458.1 (+9.1% y-o-y). Total revenues has surged to
AED 822 mn during the first half of 2025, rising 9% year-on-
year, driven mostly by room revenue and the notable 36%
year-on-year increase in MICE, fueled by high-value
weddings and year-round events.

Backed by sustained investment in world-class
infrastructure, cultural landmarks, and global events, the
UAE’s tourism and hospitality sector is set to strengthen
its role as a catalyst for long-term economic resilience,
international competitiveness, and non-oil diversification.

UAE Retail

New retail supply remained tight through the third quarter of 2025, with minimal
completions across either Dubai or Abu Dhabi recorded. Aldar’s Grove project is
set to be the next major completion with around 51,000 sqm of new retail space
set to be delivered during H1 2026 (March onwards).

However, smaller components of retail will continue to be phased across the
wider project through 2027, in line with the completion of individual residential
schemes, with around 80,000 sqm in total set to be is handed over across the
Cultural District on Saadiyat Island. This will give crucial support to the
imminent opening of the Zayed National Museum which is due to take place in
December 2025.

New supply this year is expected to reach approximately 90,000 sqm of GLA in
Dubai and 130,000 sqm in Abu Dhabi. For the period 2025 to 2027, the
development pipeline equates to 400,000 sqm in Dubai and 300,000 sqm in
Abu Dhabi.

Retail leasing demand remains firm, with multiple new high-profile deals signed
in locations like Mall of Emirates during the quarter. This includes Kim
Kardashian’s beauty brand Skims and the region’s first Ulta store. Amidst a
reshuffling of the retail mix, H&M will move to the old Debenhams store, with
new market entrant Primark taking over the old H&M space. Cinaboom have
also opened in MOE. UAE retail landlord and franchiser Al Futtaim has agreed a
major investment with Cenomi, with a 49.9% stake agreed in a deal worth SAR
2.5 bn. There was also a rare retail investment sale, with Lamcy Plaza trading for
a reported AED 188.7mn during Q3 2025.

Amid tight supply conditions, rents are expected to rise gradually across key
markets, supported by sustained population and tourism growth driving retail
sales. In Dubai, rental rates held steady at 5.3% y-o-y, while Abu Dhabi’s growth
eased to 3.3% y-o-y. The easing reflects a natural correction from previous
highs, while the shortage of premium supply is expected to sustain competitive
dynamics in the near term.

With occupancy at 97% in Dubai and 95% in
Abu Dhabi, landlords continue to hold the
upper hand - negotiations are firm, and
flexibility is rare once a space becomes
available.

Looking ahead, Majid Al Futtaim has
announced plans for a new super-regional
mall within the AED 15.4 billion Ghaf Woods
community in Dubailand. Positioned as the
region’s first forest-integrated retail
destination, the development is expected to
become a flagship experiential hub,
expected to deliver a sizeable GLA that will
help ease pressure on Dubai's retail market
over the longer term.

UAE Industrial

The Dubai market remains supply constrained as
reflected in the continued year-on-year rental growth
across the sector, with average rents rising by 18% in
Dubai and 12% in Abu Dhabi. However, there are several
largescale industrial and logistics facilities under
development with completion timings from 2026 onwards.

This includes Aldar Logistics Centers - NIP development
in the south-west of the city. Phase 1 consists of Building
1, designed for multiple occupancy with 12 warehouse
units and a BUA of 67,934 sqm. Substructure works are
ongoing and completion is expected by mid-2026. Phase 2
consists of Building 2, also multiple occupancy with 10
warehouse units and a leasable area of 52,875 sqm.
Building 3 is single occupancy / standalone facility of
27,722 sqm — both buildings set to complete in Q1 2027.

Across the other side of the city, Sweid & Sweid and
DUTCO are jointly establishing another major industrial
facility, in the Warsan area. The project, called Terralogix,
is a 305,000 sqm gated logistics hub which will offer
182,000 sqm of leasable Grade-A logistics space across 9
buildings. Over 50,000 sqm is expected to be delivered as
part of Phase 1, which is anticipated in H2 2026.

The UAE’s industrial market continues to attract
increasing interest from new investors and developers,
with a positive macro-landscape and strong sector
fundamentals creating an increasingly compelling story.
This is reflected in the strong upward rental trends across
all locations, with solid occupier demand supporting
increasingly bullish actions of the country’s industrial
Landlords. However, it is also now being reflected by the
entry_of major global institutional capital. During

CBRE RESEARCH

the quarter, several standout out deals and partnerships
have been agreed, which look set to fundamentally shift
the investment and development landscape for years to
come.

One of the most significant is the strategic partnership
between Blackstone and Abu Dhabi-based Lunate,
forming the Gulf Logistics Infrastructure Development
Enterprise (GLIDE) to invest up to USS 5 bn in Grade-A
logistics assets across the GCC. The platform will focus
on greenfield developments, selective acquisitions, and
sale-and-leaseback transactions, addressing growing
demand driven by e-commerce and manufacturing.

Another notable announcement saw Tesla’s plan to
establish its first Experience Centre in Abu Dhabi on Yas
Island revealed. While primarily a retail and service hub,
the facility will also incorporate a delivery center and
advanced servicing capabilities, signaling growing
demand for EV-related infrastructure and last-mile
logistics solutions in the UAE.

Additionally, SC Capital Partners and CapitaLand
Investment have launched the SC GCC Real Estate
Industrial Development Fund (GRID), with its inaugural
project in Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone (RAKEZ). The
development will deliver a next-generation industrial park
spanning over 300,000 sqm, expected to attract more
than 50 tenants and create approximately 1,800 jobs,
reinforcing RAK’s position as an emerging industrial hub.
